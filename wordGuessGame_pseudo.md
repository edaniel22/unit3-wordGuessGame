1. create array containing all possible words

2. randomly choose word from array 

3. display it on screen with a loop of underscores spanning length of chosen word

4. every time user guesses a letter, use a for loop to iterate through the entire word character by character checking for all instances of the letter and printing it in the correct location 

    * possibly using charat [] function

    * Lesson I learned from watching video: think about data types differently -- I'm not fully comfortable with them yet but dont be afraid to manipulate them in different ways. I say this in response to the ability to use .length to iterate through an array and add underscores in the display area for the area

5. if letter not in loop, print it in area for already guessed letter and remove one life from lives left area

6. if user guesses it completely before number of lives runs out, add 1 to the wins column and reset lives left and reset word (randomly generated)

    * also same reeset process if user loses

    * make sure randomly generated word is not repeated twice, may have to do a randomly generated sequence
